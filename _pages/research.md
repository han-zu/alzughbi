<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <strong>Graduate Research Assistant</strong><span>Jan 2024–Dec 2023</span>
  </div>
Clemson University, Clemson, SC, US
-	Conducted NSF-funded research on data privacy enhancements for user-centered studies.
-	Investigated data collection practices used by the AI research community through their user studies.
-	Researched various techniques that could limit individuals' data tracing (e.g., differential privacy).

  <strong>Research Analyst	</strong><span>Mar 2021–Feb 2022</span>
  </div>
Zeva Incorporated, Fairfax, VA, US - Remote
-	Studied security needs of three critical infrastructure sectors (including Financial Services Sector). 
-	Proposed countermeasures against potential threats, utilizing Zeva products.
-	Wrote requirements for PKI frameworks in accordance with NIST, ANSI, and ISO standards.
-	Specified how security methods (e.g., code signing) must be implemented.

  <strong> Visiting Research Scientist	</strong><span>Sep 2020–Feb 2021</span>
  </div>
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany
-	Worked on remote side-channel attacks targeting cryptographic modules.
-	Analyzed voltage-based attacks (e.g., power fluctuations), using cross-die sensors.
-	Developed a countermeasure by reverse engineering Xilinx 7-series FPGA bitstream and designing custom partial bitstreams that disable interconnects to isolate malicious tenants.

  <strong> Research Scientist	</strong><span>Jan 2019–Aug 2020</span>
  </div>
Fraunhofer Institute for Experimental Software Engineering, Kaiserslautern, Germany
-	Conducted research in the field of cybersecurity for safety-critical systems and autonomous vehicles, part of EU projects (e.g., SECREDAS and DEIS), and industry projects (e.g., Enera).
-	Assisted in creating a service for Fraunhofer clients to help them carry out safety-security analyses.
-	Coordinated two work packages in the SECREDAS project among eleven European partners and wrote a comprehensive report on each work package.
-	Improved the IEC 62559 template to enhance its usability in deriving nonfunctional requirements (e.g., security), for risk analysis teams in the energy industry.
-	Integrated digital signatures into safety-critical sensory data, communicated between autonomous vehicles, to maintain its integrity.
